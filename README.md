# Drill Press Velocity Classification through Machine Learning - Velocity Regression and Force Estimation

This project aims at measuring vibrations of a drill press and **predict its velocity** during **load and no load** operations.

Classification is performed through a *KNN-algorithm* and a *LSTM Neural Network*, comparing the results of the two techniques.
To each classified velocity is then associated the corresponding force value, obtained through load-cell measurements.

In the *doc* folder a brief report and a presentation are available for a quick overview of the project,
 besides a document explaining code structure. An Italian-only pdf explaining the objectives to be completed is provided too.
